# iOS-Application---Find-Stormtroopers
## Introduction
Inspired by Pok√©mon GO, I am really interested in augmented reality application.    
So I would like to practice and design an augmented reality hunting game of Star Wars for Star Wars funs. 
## Function
This game application, is a game that could locate user position and set a visible area.    
Then it would locate positions of different Stormtroopers and aliens on the map, allowing you to:   
  * Different users could sign up and login for his or her own game
  * Show your position on the map and show aliens' location on the map.
  * Load real view through the back camera.
  * Show the augmented reality view of Stormtroopers and aliens through back camera.
  * Show your profile.
  * and so on..
